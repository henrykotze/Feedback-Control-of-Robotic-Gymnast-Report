\section{Mechanical Hardware}
%WHAT you are going to present in this chapter/section
%WHY you are presenting it, and
%HOW you are going to present it
The mechancial design that created the physical model is presented here. The physical model allowed the abstract mathematical model to be implemented and experiments to be conducted. It will be presented by discussing the various components required and design decision made to implement a physical model that represents the mathematical model.\\

Figure \ref{fig:mech_model} shows the physical model designed and used for experiments. It emphasises some of the more critical components that were required.\\

It is important that the physical model holds the assumption made during the derivation of the robotic gymnast. These assumptions include planar dynamics of the robotic gymnast and rigid body dynamics. The assumption of planar dynamics comes in affect with the connection between the rotating shaft and the non-actuated pendulum. If the assumption holds there should be no vibration of the pendulum in any other direction than the rotating plane of the pendulums. \\

The assumption of rigid body dynamics is easily met due to the forces acting on the pendulums results in negligible strain and elongation can be ignored.

\subsection{Mechanical Components}
The components emphasised in Figure \ref{fig:mech_model} are discussed in the following section and explains their significance of use.\\

The electrical slipring converts the rotating wires that lead to the motor mounted on non-actuated pendulum to stationary wires allowing for free rotation and easy connection to the electrical design.\\

The bearing housing holds the ball-bearings in place ensuring for no unwanted vibration and misalignment. These ballbearings were press-fitted into the housing, ensuring a secure connection.\\

The potentiometer's shaft is connected to the shaft by means of a rubber tube. The rubber tube was chosen due to easy connection, allows for misalignment and the delay of measurement due to elasticity of the rubber is negligible. \\

The non-actuated pendulum is connected to the shaft by means of using 3 screws. The diameter of the shaft was kept as small as possible to reduce the inertia and friction. This method of connection was deemed the best to achieve the diameter used.

\subsection{Structural Force Analysis}
Little calculation were done to determine whether sizes chosen for the diameters of the shaft were capable of withstanding the loads. Reason being based on experience that the chosen diameters are more than enough capable of withstanding the loads. The following section will provide the proof that the selected diameters are able to carry the loads.\\

The shaft was modelled as a simple supported beam with the diameter being the smallest used in the actual design. This model is conservative due to the design being a supported by 3 distributed reaction forces. Figure \ref{fig:supp_beam} shows the conservative model.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/supported_beam/supported_beam.tikz"}
	\caption{Model of Rotating Shaft as a Simplified Beam}
	\label{fig:supp_beam}
\end{figure}

The equations () and (\ref{eq:torsionForce}) shows the maximum axial- and torsion load the beam will experience with the configuration shown in Figure \ref{fig:supp_beam} (reference shigley). The principal stresses in the shaft was than determined through equations () and () (reference). Using the conservative Von Mises yield criteria shown in equation (\ref{eq:vonMises}) the safety factor on static yielding was determined using the constants defined in Table XXX.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:axialForce}
\sigma_{f} = \frac{F\cdot l_{r}}{I}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:torsionForce}
\tau_{f} = \frac{T\cdot r}{J}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation} \label{eq:vonMises}
n_{s} = \frac{\sigma_{v}}{\sigma_{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}[(\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{2})^2+(\sigma_{2}-\sigma_{3})^2 + (\sigma_{3}-\sigma_{1})^2 ]}
\end{equation}


The shaft will experience cyclic loading due to the rotation.

\subsection{Inertia of Pendulums}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/inertia_diagram/inertia_diagram.tikz"}
	\caption{Simplified Drawing of Physical Model}
	\label{fig:model_drawing}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:model_drawing} shows a functional drawing of the physical model to visually aid the reader in understanding how the inertia of the system was determined. In equation (\ref{eq:condense1}) and (\ref{eq:condense2}) the $I_{a}$ and $I_{b}$ represents the inertia of the non-actuating and actuated pendulum about the axis coming out of the page passing through their center of mass respectively.\\

Each pendulum contains many parts that contribute to their inertia due to each part representing a different physical form. How the inertia values shown in Table \ref{table:system_param} were determined will be shown below with the physical system parameters shown in the Table \ref{table:model_param}\\

The actuated pendulum consist out of an aluminium square rod connected to the shaft and the motor mounting. The inertia of a square rod through it's center of mass is: $$ I_{cyl} = \frac{1}{12}m_{cyl}[w^2+L^2_{1}]$$

The motor, gearbox and the motor mount was viewed as a point mass. It's inertia around the center of mass of the non-actuated pendulum is: $$I_{pointmass_1} = m_{pointmass_1}\cdot[L_{1}-l_{c1}]^2 $$

The total inertia of the of the non-actuated pendulum is then: $$ I_{a} =I_{pointmass_1} +  I_{cyl} + m_{cyl}\cdot[l_{c2}-l_{cyl}]^2 $$

The actuated pendulum contains similar parts as the non-actuated pendulum. A pointmass at the bottom and an iron rod connected to the motor shaft and the pointmass. Determining the inertia is thus exactly the same as the non-actuated pendulum.\\

During the simulation it was noticed that the ratio between the unactuated and actuated pendulum should be 1 or greater for the swing-up controller to bring the robotic gymnast to the unstable equilibrium position in a feasible time frame. This is the reason behind adding another point-mass to the actuated pendulum to compensate for the inertia the motor creates as a point mass.


\begin{table}[]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Non-Actuated Pendulum& Value & Actuated Pendulum & Value \\
		\hline
		\hline

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Physical Model Paramaters}
	\label{table:model_param}
\end{table}

\subsection{Center of Mass}
Each pendulum can be seen as a system containing discrete components, where each components center of mass is easily identified. Both iron rod and aluminium rod center of mass is in the middle of their rod lenght and the rest are seen as point masses. However each of these components center of mass contribute to the center of mass of each pendulum.\\

The center of mass for each pendulum from their hinge of rotation shown in Table \ref{table:centerOfMass} was calculated using equation (\ref{eq:centerOfMass}).

\begin{equation} \label{eq:centerOfMass}
\vec{\boldmath{r}} = \frac{\sum_{i}^{j}r_{i}m_{i}}{\sum_{i}^{j}m_{i}}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Pendulum & Center of Mass [\SI{}{m}] \\
		\hline
		\hline
		Non-Actuated  & \SI{0.2056}{} \\
		\hline
		Actuated  & \SI{0.2115}{} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Center of Mass for Each Pendulum from their Rotating Hinge}
	\label{table:centerOfMass}
\end{table}


\subsection{Motor}
The chosen motor used during experiments was the \textit{Faulhaber DC 3257 012 CR} micromotor. It was used in combination with the \textit{Faulhaber Planetary Gearhead 32/3} Series. The gearbox is a 2 stage reduction gearbox with a overall rounded reduction ratio of 14:1. The motor is capable of providing a stall torque of \SI{539}{mNm} which is a converted output torque from the gearbox of \SI{7.646}{Nm}.\\

The motor terminal connection is connected directly to the PCB of the electronic design being routed through the slipring. The motor assembly contains a encoder for position measurements and it's signal and power connection is also routed through the slipring and connected to the PCB.

\section{Electronic Hardware}
%WHAT you are going to present in this chapter/section
%WHY you are presenting it, and
%HOW you are going to present it
The electronic hardware was a crucial component for the successful implementation of the robotic gymnast. The electronic design provided the means to determine the system characteristic and verification of the simulated model. It will be presented by discussing the various components implemented to achieve the results in this report.

\subsection{System Description}

% Show block diagram of the system and explain the functioning og the system
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/Electronic_System/ElectronicSystemOverview.tikz"}
	\caption{Electronic System Overview}
	\label{fig:electronicSystemOverview}
\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:electronicSystemOverview} provides a system overview on how the different subsystems functions together and what inputs are outside from the PCB design.\\

The micro-controller receives the different signals that has been correctly conditioned from supporting circuitry to interpret the dynamics of the system. From these signals it is able to output the correct signals to instruct the next command to the motor.\\

The digital logic circuit that consist of logic level converters acquires the signal from the micro-controller and performs signal conditioning to interface with the motor driver and determines the correct direction to rotate the motor. \\

The motor driver controls the DC brushed motor based of the digital signals and provides a proportional feedback current that is delivered to the unity-gain amplifier.\\

The motor contains an encoder that indicates the direction and position of the rotor through digital signals that is sent through a digital logic filter to retrieve only critical information from the encoder signals. \\

The physical model contains a potentiometer that measures the non-actuated pendulum's angle and this signal is sent to the unity-gain amplifier.\\

The microcontroller will use the UART interface as it's data acquisition protocol to send the necessary information to the computer. \\

The micro-controller is programmed using the Serial Wire Debug (SWD) protocol to transfer the binaries from the computer.\\

Power is provided using a external 12V power-supply, which will power the motor, but also using a regulator to down convert/step to a 5V and 3.3V to power the microcontoller and the other peripherals.


\subsection{Microcontroller}
The microcontroller chosen is the STM32F030Mxx. The selection was done according to the ease of setting up, memory size, physical dimensions and the peripherals it provided. These selection are expanded below.

The STM32F030MXX is based of the ARM M0 architecture which is ARM's entry level micro-controller. It requires little support circuitry to have a up and running micro-controller with only the SWD protocol to program the chip.\\

It was difficult to determine the memory size specification for the project. This uncertainty ensured that the largest memory size the ARM M0 architecture could provide was selected.\\

The Electrical and Electronic Department's Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing machine can only provide a  minimum track width \SI{0.3}{mm}. This resulted in choosing a microcontroller whose footprint would meet this requirement.\\

Based on the conceptual design, the chosen microcontroller required to contain 2 ADC's channels, minimum of 5 GPIO's and 1 serial communication peripheral. 

\subsubsection{Programming / Debug Interface}
The \textit{Atollic TrueSTUDIO for ARM 8.0.0} Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was used for writing the source code which converts the source code to the Executable and Linkable Format (.elf) file. These .elf files is then written using the SWD protocol to the micro-controller. Debugging of the source code occurred using the same IDE which allows the programmer to inspect variables, timers and logic.

\subsubsection{PC UART Interface }

The purpose of the UART to serial communication was for data acquisition of the system response and for debugging.\\

The UART to serial communication was implemented due to the external computer executing a Python script listening for any activity on the computer's driver port for information about the system.\\

The UART to serial communication was also used for debugging the system. Special instruction from the Python script could be sent to verify correct sampling of signals, manual control over the duty-cycle of the PWM signal and directional control of the motor. It also acted as a soft layer for safety by sending commands to arm the system before experiments. \\

The UART to Serial chip used was the FT230x (USB to BASIC UART IC). It was chosen due the easily support circuitry it requires with the option to use LED's to indicate any activity on the receive (Rx)  \& transmit (Tx) communication lines.\\

 
The UART to serial circuit was tested by doing a loop-back test. The loop-back test consist of connecting the Tx and Rx lines together. This results in the circuit echoing anything back to the receiver. The schematic of the circuitry is shown in Appendix \ref{sec:schematics}.


\subsection{Voltage Regulation}

The various components used in the electronic design required different supply voltages and are tabulated in Table \ref{table:supplyVoltage}.\\


\begin{table}[]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Component & Supply Voltage [\SI{}{V}] \\
		\hline
		\hline
		Digital Logic, Op-Amp \& Sensors & \SI{5}{} \\
		\hline
		Microcontroller & \SI{3.3}{} \\
		\hline
		Motor Driver & \SI{12}{} \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Suppy Voltage's for the different components}
	\label{table:supplyVoltage}
\end{table}

The \SI{12}{V} supply was provided using an external bench power-supply. The \SI{5}{V} and \SI{3.3}{V} was provided using linear voltage regulators for each voltage. The schematic for each voltage regulator are shown in Appendix \ref{sec:schematics}, where each voltage regulator circuit includes a Light Emitting Diode (LED) to ensure the minimum load was met for each regulator. The LED also acts as a visual debugging method.

\subsection{Potentiometer Sensor}
\subsubsection{Working Principle}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"figs/potentiometer/potentiometer.tikz"}
	\caption{Simplified Model of a Potentiometer}
	\label{fig:potentiometer}
\end{figure}
The rotary position potentiometer consist out of a wiper that is attached to a rotating shaft. This wiper moves across a internal resistor as the shaft rotates and changes the effective resistance across the output terminal. It provides thus a proportional voltage to it's position as seen in Figure \ref{fig:potentiometer} that indicates the position.

\subsubsection{Interface}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/unitygain/unitygain.tikz"}
	\caption{Unity Gain Amplifier Circuit}
	\label{fig:unitygain}
\end{figure}
The signal produced by the rotary potentiometer varies from 4.95V and 50mV as it rotates from 360\textdegree \space to 0\textdegree. This signal is sent through a simple voltage divider circuit to reduce the signal to 3V and 15mV to be within the sampling limits of the micro-controller. The scaled voltage is then sent through a unity gain rail-to-rail amplifier, where the mirrored output signal is fed into the ADC.\\

The type of ADC used in the STM32F030XX is a successive approximation register (SAR) and contains an internal capacitors that suffers from the effect of being depleted if the sampling frequency is to high \citep{stm32_ADC:2017}. Using an operational amplifier reduces the risk of depleting this internal capacitor because of the low output resistance. The schematic of the circuit is shown in Appendix \ref{sec:schematics}.\\

\subsection{Magnetic Encoder}
\subsubsection{Working Principle}
A rotating gear containing ferrous metal teeth is attach to the rotating shaft. The rotating metal teeth rotates near a hall-effect sensor which creates a change in the magnetic flux inside the hall-sensor. This change in magnetic flux is sensed by the hallsensor which produces a digital signal \citep{hallsensor}.
\subsubsection{Digital Interface} 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"figs/JK_XOR_gates/jk_xor_nor.tikz"}
	\caption{Digital Logic Circuit containing JK-Flipflops, XOR- and NOR Gates}
	\label{fig:jk_xor}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/xor_waveform/xor_waveform.tikz"}
	\caption{Waveform of the JK-Flipflop,XOR, and NOR Gate Circuit}
	\label{fig:jk_xor_waveform}
\end{figure}

The encoder contains a sold state hallsensor which provides 2 channels with a 90\textdegree \space phase difference between the them. \citep{faulhaberencoder}. These 2 signals under go a hardware filter that produces 2 signals that indicate the direction of the motor and the incremental position.\\

The hardware filter consist out of XOR, NOR and JK-Flipflop gates shown in Figure \ref{fig:jk_xor} and the schematic is in Appendix \ref{sec:schematics}. The XOR gate produces the incremental change of position of the motor which is then read by the microcontroller using interrupts on rising and falling edges. The output of the XOR gate is shown in Figure \ref{fig:jk_xor_waveform}.\\

The resolution of the encoder is 16 lines per revolution per channel, equalling to a combined 64 rising- \& falling edges in total. The encoder is connected directly to the motor shaft whose speed is reduced by the 14:1 reduction gearbox. The encoder will thus rotate 14 times per output shaft revolution, increasing the resolution to 896 edges per revolution.\\

 The NOR and JK-Flipflop combination produces the direction of the motor by determining whether phase A leads or lags phase B by 90\textdegree. This leading or lagging is indicated by a logical 1 or 0 which is read by the microntroller shown in Figure \ref{fig:jk_xor_waveform}.\\
 
 The hardware filter was implemented to reduce the processing time the micro-controller was required to do retrieve the information in the 2 signals.



\subsection{Motor Driver}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/feedback_current/feedback_current.tikz"}
	\caption{Simplified Circuit of Motor Feedback}
	\label{fig:feedback_current}
\end{figure}


The motor driver chosen is the MC33887. It was selected based on providing the motor up to 6A of current, while withstanding the high current transients due to the fast switching of a inductive load \citep{motorIC}. The motor driver provides the motor with 12V DC which is externally provided by a DC power supply. The schematic of the motor driver is shown in Appendix \ref{sec:schematics}.\\

The motor driver is connected directly to the motor and responsible for directional and rotational control of the brushed DC motor. The motor driver contains 2 half H-bridges that forms a full H-bridge which are Pulse-Width-Modulated (PWM) to control the speed of the motor and originates from the microcontroller. The selected frequency was 10kHz and is recommended by the manufacturers \cite{motorIC}. As discussed previously, the signals' logic level is first converted and then sent through the AND digital filter before the motor driver receives it.\\


The MC33887 provides a proportional current of $\frac{1}{375}$ of the current flowing through the high-side of the full H-bridge \citep{motorIC}. This current is sent through a resistor of \SI{150}{\Omega} to provide a voltage signal to represent the current. Due to the motor being controlled using PWM, the current is a periodic impulse signal making it almost impossible for the ADC to sample. This problem was overcome by adding a parallel capacitor to the resistor to create a ripple voltage. This ripple voltage is sent through an unity-gain amplifier as seen in Figure \ref{fig:unitygain} before it is sampled by the micro-controller. The $R_{\text{input}}$ resistance is the input resistance that the operational amplifier sees and will be the \SI{150}{\Omega}. This closes the feedback loop to implement torque control by the control system.\\


\subsubsection{Logic Level Converters}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/Logic_Level_Converter/LogicLevelConverterAndInverter.tikz"}
	\caption{Logic Level Converter \& Inverter Circuit}
	\label{fig:interterCirc}
\end{figure}


The microcontroller is required to interface with the motor driver and represent a logical high and low as a \SI{3.3}{V} and \SI{0}{V} respectively. The motor driver's logical high threshold is \SI{3.5}{V}. It is thus required to use a logic level converter to allow reliable communication between the two devices.\\

The logic level converter used is shown in Figure \ref{fig:interterCirc} and uses the BSS128 transistor. The circuit shown also acts as a inverter where a logic low, \SI{0}{V} by the micro-controller will be converted to a \SI{5}{V} and a logic high, \SI{3.3}{V} will be converted to \SI{0}{V}. This side effect is overcome by inverting the desired responses in software.


\subsubsection{AND Digital Circuit}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/AND_gates/ANDgates.tikz"}
	\caption{AND digital logic with inverter}
	\label{fig:andCircuit}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{"./figs/and_waveform/and_waveform.tikz"}
	\caption{AND Digital Logic Circuit Waveforms}
	\label{fig:andCircuit_waveform}
\end{figure}

The motor driver contains 2 input pins which controls the voltage polarity of the motor terminals. Keeping the one input high and the other low will turn the motor in the one direction and switching the logical values on these inputs will turn the motor on the other direction. Adding speed control requires the PWM signal that the motor receives to be alternated on these inputs and are done by the AND digital circuit.\\

The AND circuit receives 2 signals from the microcontroller  after it has been converted to the correct logic level: the PWM signal and a logic level signal indicating the desired direction. Based on the directional signal the AND circuit will switch the PWM signal between the 2 inputs of the motor driver while holding the other low as seen in Figure \ref{fig:andCircuit_waveform}.\\

This hardware directional control was done in order to reduce the processing time the microcontroller is required to do to switch the generated PWM signal between the 2 inputs of the motor driver.

\subsection{Verification Tests}

\subsubsection{Angle Sensor Measurements}

\subsubsection{Optical Encoder Measurements}

\subsubsection{ PWM Duty Cycle to Motor Current}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{./figs/dutycycle_vs_current.eps}
	\caption{Relationship between Duty-Cycle of PWM Signal and Current through Motor}
	\label{fig:dutycycle_vs_current}
\end{figure}

The input to the system is the torque delivered by the motor and the magnitude and direction is determined by the control laws. The model describing the system in equation (\ref{eq:condense2}) assumes the torque delivered to the system is instantaneously available. This is inaccurate due to the model describing the DC motor is a second-order differential equation containing it's own time-constant. This model was not incorporated due adding another control loop would add more delays to the control systems. To overcome this, the torque provided by the motor would be mapped to the duty-cycle the motor receives.\\

Experiments were done to determine the relationship between the duty-cycle of the PWM signal and the torque delivered by the motor. These experiments are done by incrementing the duty-cycle of the PWM signal that the motor receives when the shaft is kept fix against a hard-stop. The mean value of the output voltage from the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:feedback_current} was measured on the oscilloscope and mapped backwards to determine the torque using equation (\ref{eq:duty2current}) with the constants shown in Table \ref{table:duty2current_constants}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:duty2current}
\tau = \frac{V}{R}\cdot GR \cdot FR \cdot \alpha_{t}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Constant & Description & Value \\
		\hline
		\hline
		GR &  Gear Ratio & 14 \\
		\hline
		FR & Feedback Current Ratio & 375 \\
		\hline
		$\alpha_{t}$ & Torque Constant & $19.1\times 10^{-3}$ \\
		\hline
		R & Resistance & 150 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Values of Constants used in Equation (\ref{eq:duty2current})}
	\label{table:duty2current_constants}
\end{table}

 Figure \ref{fig:dutycycle_vs_current} shows the measured data with a line of best fit. It is clear that there exist a linear relationship between the duty-cycle of the PWM signal and the torque provided. This equation of best fit will thus be used to output the correct torque determined by the control system.
