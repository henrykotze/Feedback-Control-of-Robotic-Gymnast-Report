%HOW you are going to present it
A short description of the various improvements that can be made if future attempts are made on \textit{The Feedback Control Of A Robotic Gymnast} with the hope to improve the results given in the report.\\

Choosing a more advanced microcontroller that is able to use a baudrate greater than 115200 would improve response time and provide better control of the system.\\

Implementing a digital low pass filter to remove the noise on the sampled signal. Especially on the signals that are required to be numerically differentiated.\\

The script executing on the external computer can be written in a language such as C or C++ to increase the execution time of the script.\\
