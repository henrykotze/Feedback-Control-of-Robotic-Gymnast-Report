		\textbf{ECSA Exit Level Outcomes} & \textbf{ELO} & \textbf{Section of Report} & \textbf{Comment}   \\
		\hline
		Problem Solving &1& \ref{sec:simulation_model} , \ref{sec:system_identification}, \ref{sec:electronic_hardware}, \ref{chp:software_design}, \ref{sec:system_overview} & The project was develop using a system engineering approach. Problems were solved in the simulation program, debugging of issues within the electronic system and implementing the controllers on the external computer      \\
		\hline
		Application of Scientific and Engineering Knowledge	&2&\ref{sec:mathematical_model}, \ref{sec:simulation_model}, \ref{sec:system_identification}, \ref{chp:feedback_control_design}&The mathematical model was derived and implemented on a simulation program. The system identification was done to identify how to model the system    \\
		\hline
		Engineering Design&3& \ref{sec:mechanical_hardware}, \ref{sec:electronic_hardware}, \ref{chp:software_design} & The mechanical, electronic and sofware designs were done to implement and test the mathematical model  	\\
		\hline
		Engineering Methods, Skills and Tools&5& \ref{sec:simulation_model}, \ref{sec:electronic_hardware}, \ref{sec:mechanical_hardware} & MATLAB, Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and  Computer-aided Design (CAD) programs were extensively used. \\
		\hline
		Professional and Technical Communication&6&\ref{chp:introduction} - \ref{chp:conclusion}  & The writing of the report to present the results of the project, an oral exam towards a engineering audience and creating a poster for a community \\
		\hline
		Individual, Team and Multidisciplinary Working&8&\ref{chp:introduction}-\ref{chp:conclusion}& The main objectives were achieved on time with supervision throughout the year from a study leader  \\
		\hline
		Independent Learning Ability&9& \ref{sec:literature_study}, \ref{chp:controller}&  Research on the various approaches were done and then implemented\\
